        <p>
          Developed a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that allows users to
          create and share personalized ai persona&apos;s to chat with.
        </p>
        <p>
          The motivation behind this project was to explore MLOps/LLMOps,
          particularly infrastructure and how to make interaction with LLM
          API&apos;s i.e. Replicate and OpenAI production ready and effective.
          This lead me to explore vector databases, and how LLM chat
          history/memory can effectively be managed. It also led me to explore
          edge computing and the concept of streaming, and why its a superior
          approach then the traditional serverless functions. Also, got to
          implement my learnings from Andrew Ng&apos;s short courses on
          Langchain which made the prompt engineering part seamless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, this is my first ever attempt at building out a SaaS, so
          I learned cool tech like Stripe and how role-based
          authentication/authorization works via Clerk, helping me set up
          protected routes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must say ShadCN&apos;s UI components are amazing and make the front
          end development experience (something I notoriously find tedious and
          unejoyable) super satisfying, not to mention the UI actually looks
          good, is accessible, and mobile friendly!!
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
          BTW the Stripe integration is in test mode, so it&apos;s not a
          &quot;real&quot; SaaS product; feel free to use the numerous test

          I developed a machine learning pipeline using PyTorch to generate and

          learning
        </p>
        <p>
          The motivation behind this project was to uncover a novel layer in
          environmental monitoring and land-use planning by combining the power
          of the EfficientNetV2 architecture for classification and the
          Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there were challenges, such as the VAE producing blurry
          images and underperforming compared to the baseline generator, the
          project represented an insightful initial step towards leveraging
          computer vision for land monitoring purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was my first attempt at uncovering the potential of combining

        <p>
          In this project, inspired by Brazil&apos;s loss in the 2014 World Cup
          due to Neymar&apos;s injury, I used machine learning to predict soccer
          injuries, an important yet overlooked facet of the beautiful game.
        </p>
        <p>
          After scraping data from Transfermarkt and FBREF, I tackled issues of
          class imbalance and low-correlation features using techniques like
          SMOTE oversampling, feature engineering, and feature scaling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed several models including logistic regression, random
          forest, and an ANN. Through extensive hyperparamter tuning through
          grid search and random search, the logistic regression model with L2
          loss stood out, demonstrating an impressive ROC AUC of 0.726 and a
          recall of 0.851.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite early setbacks with low-correlation features and poor initial
          model performances, my investigation into soccer injuries made
          significant strides by successfully identified injury-prone players,
          like Neymar, and despite its tendency to overlabel healthy players as
          at-risk, it provided valuable insights, setting a promising foundation
          for future research into global datasets and additional relevant
          features.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
          Motivation for this project is highly inspired by the movie Money Ball
          and my own love for Football.

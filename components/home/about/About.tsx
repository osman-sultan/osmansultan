              Hi‚úåÔ∏è, I&apos;m Osman. My goal lies in making interactions between
              humans and tech as accessible as possible. Based in the Greater
              Toronto Area, my path is consistently fueled by curiosity,
              absorbing all that I can from the many remarkable people around
              meüöò.

              (8+ cylinders, rotary, or bust), and the thought that Messi might

                Working at a startup truly means wearing multiple hats, and my
                experience has been a testament to that. Initially hired for web

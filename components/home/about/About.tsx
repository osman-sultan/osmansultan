              Hello world‚úåÔ∏è, I&apos;m Osman. I&apos;m a bit all over the place
              but my goal lies in making interactions between humans and tech as
              accessible as possible. Based in the Greater Toronto Area,
              I&apos;m on a constant journey fueled by curiosity, absorbing all
              that I can from the many remarkable people around meüöò.

              As an unfortunate victim of FOMO, I&apos;m a serial hobby hopper.
              Currently, my interests lie in walkable cities (I&apos;m a
              Mississauga nativeüõ£Ô∏è lol), cars (preferably with 8+ cylinders or a
              rotary), The Crew Motofest, and the thought that Messi might play
              at BMO field‚öΩ.

                People don&apos;t lie when they say you wear multiple hats at a
                start up. What was initially a web dev role quickly turned into
                a infrastructure, devops, and backend architect role, and I love
                it. My manager put full faith that us interns can take on a
                whole database migration - and we did :).
